# Dynamic Pricing Strategy Using Python

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a **Dynamic Pricing Strategy** using Python. It showcases how to analyze customer behavior, market trends, and other variables to dynamically adjust prices for products or services.

## 📌 Overview

Dynamic pricing is an advanced pricing strategy that adjusts prices based on demand, competition, or market conditions. This project utilizes **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **optimization techniques** to implement a dynamic pricing model.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Demand Forecasting**:
  - Predict future demand using time series analysis and regression models.
- **Elasticity Analysis**:
  - Determine price sensitivity of customers using price elasticity of demand.
- **Dynamic Price Adjustment**:
  - Implement machine learning models to recommend optimized prices.
- **Visualization**:
  - Graphical representation of price trends, demand, and revenue.
- **Scenario Analysis**:
  - Simulate pricing strategies for different market conditions.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn.
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook.

## 🛠️ Installation

1.	Clone the repository:
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yaserselvam/Dynamic-Pricing-Strategy.git
cd Dynamic-Pricing-Strategy
```

2.	Run the Jupyter Notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 📚 Usage

1.	Place your dataset in the data/ directory.
2.	Use the EDA and Preprocessing notebook to analyze and clean the data.
3.	Train the demand forecasting model using Model Training notebook.
4.	Use testing.py to calculate optimal prices for different scenarios.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Incorporate real-time data streams for dynamic updates.
- Extend pricing models to include multi-product optimization.
- Integrate competitor pricing and market trends into the model.
- Build a complete web-based dashboard for non-technical users.
